  This app will launch [Jupyter] Notebook or Lab on a Quest compute node. 

  The Jupyter session can use IPython Kernels that you have created yourself on Quest. For details on how to do this, please see the instructions on [Running Jupyter Notebook on Quest].

  This Jupyter instance comes with a single pre-built Kernel called `ml-data-science-kernel-py310` and was creating using the following command:

  ```
  CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA="11.2" mamba create --name ml-data-science-kernel-py310 -c conda-forge tensorflow pytorch python=3.10 seaborn h5py numba pandas matplotlib ipykernel scikit-learn scikit-image openpyxl sqlalchemy numexpr pyspark dask spacy transformers cudatoolkit=11.2 --yes
  ```
